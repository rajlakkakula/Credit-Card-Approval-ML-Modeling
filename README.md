# Credit-Card-Approval-ML-Modeling
In this post, I will build two machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision tree-based (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) methods to predict the accuracy of credit card approval using a set of features. I will compare the accuracy and other metrics associated with their predictions.
